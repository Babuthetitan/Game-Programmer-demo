Personal project demo for audio programmer position

I am using my indie video game demo to showcase the ropes within C++ and Wwise engine. I am integrating Wwise with this unity project to create my own proprietary tools for advanced game audio depth. This project contains both Wwise middleware skills, understanding of C# unity skills and Wwise C++ skills. I have created a custom Wwise gain plugin using python dependencies, C++ within the Wwise SDK and DSP math code.

In this repo, I have a video walkthrough to showcase everything.
The project itself which will require you to have unity & Wwise but I have a folder with a zip where you can extract and play the game
